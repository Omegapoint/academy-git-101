# Prerequisites

Please make sure that you have done the following:

- Create a Github account
- Connect Github account to Omegapoint organization
- Create SSH keypair (see "Authentication with SSH" for instructions)
- Add SSH public key to Github account (see "Authentication with SSH" for instructions)

# Instructions

This exercise is designed for you to follow along. There will be short texts describing and explaining what should be done followed by code blocks with the commands to run. 

You should place these instructions in one window and have a terminal window open beside it so that you can type the commands.

In the code blocks, every line starting with a $ sign is a command to run (you skip the $ sign itself!). Every line starting with a # sign is a comment that explains or give some more detail about the following command. All other lines are output 

Most of the steps assume that you have run every step up to that point, so make sure you run every command in the correct order or that your Git repository is in an equivalent state.
