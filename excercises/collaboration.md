# Collaboration - merge, rebase and resolve conflicts

# Prerequisites

This excercise assumes the following:

- You have installed Git (see https://git-scm.com/downloads for instructions)
- You run the commands in a Bash shell terminal (on Windows, use Git Bash or equivalent)
- You have configured Git with your name and email with the following commands:

      git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      git config --global user.email "your.name@omegapoint.se"

- You have a Github account that is connected to the Omegapoint organization (see the "Remote repositories" part of the course for instructions)

# Instructions

This exercise is designed for you to follow along. There will be short texts describing and explaining what should be done followed by code blocks with the commands to run. 

You should place these instructions in one window and have a terminal window open beside it so that you can type the commands.

In the code blocks, every line starting with a $ sign is a command to run (you skip the $ sign itself!). Every line starting with a # sign is a comment that explains or give some more detail about the following command. All other lines are output 

Most of the steps assume that you have run every step up to that point, so make sure you run every command in the correct order or that your Git repository is in an equivalent state.
